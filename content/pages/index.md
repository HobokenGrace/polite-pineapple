    title: 'Hello, New Group Leader! '
    content: "First – congrats and thank you for stepping into a leadership role at Hoboken Grace. Dinner Group is vital to building our community, and you — our Dinner Group Leaders — are vital to our mission of helping people find their way back to God.\_\n\nAfter ten years, we’ve learned and heard a thing or two that we think can help you as a leader and help your group, too. This guide is designed to partner with you through the first ten weeks of your group until you get confident to set your own plan.\_ Our goal in this is to give you the margin to develop relationships within your group and less on worrying what’s coming next.\_\n\nThis is just a beta so be sure to stop back frequently as we’ll be posting new content designed just for you. Don’t see what you’re looking for? Reach out to\_[dinnergroups@hobokengrace.com](mailto:X@hobokengrace.com)\_so we can better support you.\n\nWelcome to the Team!\n"
